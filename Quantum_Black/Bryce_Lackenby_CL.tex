	\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}
	My name is Bryce Lackenby and I am writing to you with regard to the position of Data Scientist at Tigerspike.\\

	I have recently graduated with a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of New South Wales and I am looking to become involved in the data science sector. I have a great interest in the applicability of data driven process and how modern tools can solve problems in business and society. I have experience in the field of machine learning (neural networks, decision trees and regression algorithms) and other applied statistics along with a deep understanding of how these models and algorithms work.\\

	I am looking to apply and further develop these skills, along with others, in solving a diverse range of problems. To solve these problems I am able to understand new concepts and implement them quickly.\\

	I hope you consider me for the position, I believe I can offer a lot to your organisation. \\

  Regards, \\
  Bryce.
