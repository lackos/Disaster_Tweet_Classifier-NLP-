## Kaggle Disaster tweet competition
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started]
This objective of this competition is to use NLP methods to determine if a tweet
is about a natural disaster or not, a two class classification problem. A large
training data set of ~ 7000 tweetsis supplied and a testing set for submission.

### Notes on the Data
* From the data exploration the percentage of positive to  negative tweets is ~42% and therefore class imbalance should not be a large problem.
